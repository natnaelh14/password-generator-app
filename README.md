Project Name: Password Generator Application
GitHub Link: https://natnaelh14.github.io/password-generator-app/

In this project, i created a password generator application. Instead of using propmt() and alert() to interact with the user, I created input elements
in the html. I also created elements in html to post error messages, instead of using the methods above. 
I utilized event listeners to run the functions, when reset/copy/generate buttons are clicked.

I created an object that includes all the characters to be used. Then I created function that loops through for the length of the password and generates 
a random password using only user's choice of characters.

I appreciate any feedback. Thanks!
